The enclosure is specific to my setup - as LED and other parts are handsoldered to the board. 
THe position of the LED is very specific to how I have soldered the components and will change for other people.  

USB connector opening should be made thinner or larger to allow for proper connection with cable. 

Height of the ESP32 board is modified from the standard height because before I designed enclosure, I covered the pins with glue to prevent shorts as board was kept open. This may cause height deviation.
